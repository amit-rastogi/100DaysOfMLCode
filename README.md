The below topics are as per the syllabus of the Udemy course - Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science.
    
Day 1 - started with Linear regression in python using sklearn.  
Day 2 - Multiple linear regression in python using sklearn. Concept of backward elimination.  
Day 3 - Polynomial regression in python using sklearn. Concept of imputation of missing data, label encoding, one hot encoding and feature scaling.  
Day 4 - SVR and Decision Tree regression in python using sklearn.  
Day 5 - Random forest regression, classification modelling with Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM in python using sklearn. Using confusion matrix for model evaluation.  
Day 6 - started with the prerequisites for the course “Machine Learning crash course with Tensorflow APIs” by Google  
a). Quick introduction to pandas  
b). Tensorflow programming concepts (tensors, operations, graphs, sessions)  
Got familiar with jupyter notebook and created a tensorflow program to add numbers (source code uploaded in the github repository)    
Day 7 - Naive Bayes, decision tree and random forest classification using sklearn in python. 
Creating and Manipulating Tensors (tensor shapes, matrix multiplication, reshaping).  
Day 8 - Studied NLP and implemented user review prediction model using NLTK in python with Bag of Words model and Naïve Bayes classification.
