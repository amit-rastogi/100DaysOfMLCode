-----------------
The below topics are as per the syllabus of the Udemy course - Machine Learning A-Z‚Ñ¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science.
    
Day 1 - started with Linear regression in python using sklearn.  
Day 2 - Multiple linear regression in python using sklearn. Concept of backward elimination.  
Day 3 - Polynomial regression in python using sklearn. Concept of imputation of missing data, label encoding, one hot encoding and feature scaling.  
Day 4 - SVR and Decision Tree regression in python using sklearn.  
Day 5 - Random forest regression, classification modelling with Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM in python using sklearn. Using confusion matrix for model evaluation.  
Day 6 - started with the prerequisites for the course ‚ÄúMachine Learning crash course with Tensorflow APIs‚Äù by Google  
a). Quick introduction to pandas  
b). Tensorflow programming concepts (tensors, operations, graphs, sessions)  
Got familiar with jupyter notebook and created a tensorflow program to add numbers (source code uploaded in the github repository)    
Day 7 - Naive Bayes, decision tree and random forest classification using sklearn in python. 
Creating and Manipulating Tensors (tensor shapes, matrix multiplication, reshaping).  
Day 8 - Studied NLP and implemented user review prediction model using NLTK in python with Bag of Words model and Na√Øve Bayes classification.  
Day 9 - Covered the following-  
1.K-means clustering and using the elbow method to choose the right number of clusters using WCSS.  
2.Association rule learning with Apriori model.  
Day 10 - Studied k-fold cross validation and Grid search and started learning Keras.  
Day 11 - Watched the recorded Salt Identification Challenge by @sirajraval. Not much into CNNs yet but learnt many things like using google colab, importing kaggle dataset in colab, UNet. Started on the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques on kaggle.   
Day 12- Submitted the code for the The House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques problem on Kaggle. Score - 0.14998. Rank-2546. Feeling good!!! Now have to work on improving the score.  
Day 13- Continued on The House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques problem on Kaggle. Used  XGBoost and improved the model accuracy. Score - 0.13497. Rank-1826. Moved up 1065 spots on #kaggle. I'm not addicted. I can quit when I want.  
Day 14-Started on the Move 37 Course. Completed lesson on Bellman equation and Markov decision processes...that was something serious had to take notes to reinforce the learning üòÉ  
Day 15-Exploring spacy library @spacy_io for NLP in python. Liked its object oriented model as compared to NLTK and its syntactic dependency visualizer. Sample code uploaded in github.
